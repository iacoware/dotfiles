Other things to install/rember that I've not (yet) automated:

-   Paragon NTFS driver to write on NTFS volumes
-   Install the CLI that enable logging hours within Toggl (Python app)
-   install ohmyzsh
    -   `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
    - disable directories aliases (rename lib/directories.zsh to lib/directories.not_zsh to avoid loading)
- iterm tweaks
    - theme

### macOS teaks
