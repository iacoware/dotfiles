Other things to install/rember that I've not automated:

- AX88179 drivers (USB3 -> GB ethernet adapter)
http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php

- Tunnelblick VPN client (cask installation doesn't work as expected)

- Window manager (drag to snap, keyboard shortcuts, increase/decrease size)
(Flexiglass/Magnet/ShiftIt/phoenix)
