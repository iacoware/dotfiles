Other things to install/rember that I've not automated:

- XCode installation is required (from AppStore) for nodejs native modules (node-gyp)

- AX88179 drivers (USB3 -> GB ethernet adapter)
http://www.asix.com.tw/download.php

- Tunnelblick VPN client (cask installation doesn't work as expected)

- Window manager (drag to snap, keyboard shortcuts, increase/decrease size, zoom-maximize)
(Flexiglass/Magnet/ShiftIt/phoenix)

- Common shortcuts (That I always forgot...)
	CMD + SHIFT + 3 = Screenshot entire desktop
	CMD + SHIFT + 4 = Select part of the monitor
